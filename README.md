My vimrc file, I made a lightweight version from [The ultimate Vim configuration: vimrc ](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)

# Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:soleverlee/lightvimrc.git
cd lightvimrc
cp _vimrc ~/.vimrc
bash install.sh
```
The `install.sh` will use pathogen plugin manager to manage vim plugins, and each plugin will be cloned by `git` into the `bundle` folder.It's safe to execute it anytime you want because it'll check if the folder exists.

# Plugins
Here is all plugins used in this script:
